#Stock-analysis#
Analyzing stock data with VBA 

##Overview of Project##
The purpose of the project is to analyze and observe the benefits of refactoring code. The analysis was performed on two datasets which include stock data from the years 2017 and 2018. Each dataset contained 3012 items and recorded select daily activity of 12 stocks. The stock data collected was divided into eight columns, including ticker, date, high, low, open, close, adjusted close, and volume.  
At the conclusion of Module 2, we ran code that analyzed and extracted specfic data from our dataset. The challenge is to refactor code in effort to make the program run more efficiently. Code performance was objectively measured by a timer, which measured the total time it took to run the macro and store data in our workbook.

##Results##
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).

##Summary##
**Refactoring: Advantages & Disadvantages**
Code performance is often a critical component in machine based learning systems and improving aspects of code can make significant differences in the functionality of programs and their applications in the world, with a notable example being real-time naviagation applications.

There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script (3 pt).
